# Goal
This project aims to teach me React and ES6 level Javascript. It will use Docker
and docker compose to cement that knowledge. This project will not use
Typescript, a SQL database, or any other sort of outside component. Community
React libraries are allowed.

# Vision
A website to create and list the results of a race. There should be a home page,
(at least) a page for results and a page to create / update results. Deletion is
not to be undertaken.
